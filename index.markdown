## About Catherine

Catherine Soileau Heitman is a communications strategist with more
than three decades of executive-level experience in issues and
reputational management, government agency transformation, and
disaster and crisis response. She has worked in journalism and held
posts at multiple agencies at the state and federal level — as a
Congressional aide in Washington and in Louisiana.

Her experience includes corporate consulting and executive positions
in multiple state agencies, developing and implementing public
awareness and engagement campaigns around some of society’s most
pressing issues: human services, food insecurity, pre-K to 12 and
higher education policy, child welfare, and disaster response and
recovery.

Her disaster communication experience began with hurricanes Katrina
and Rita and continued years later with Louisiana's innovative
sheltering and food assistance operations following the compound
disaster of the COVID-19 pandemic and a punishing string of major
hurricanes (Laura, Delta, Zeta and Ida). The response and targeted
digital communication strategies Heitman helped develop have served as
national models.
